# Advent of Python 

My solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) implemented as a Python program.

This repository holds my solutions to Advent of Code problems and my experiments with [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.0.x/), a Python framework for creating cli tools.

## Setup

Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate it:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies and build:

```bash
pip install .

# or use this for development mode so rebuild/reinstall isn't necessary after 
# each change that is made during development
pip install -e .
```

Install dev dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
